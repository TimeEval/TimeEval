# User Guides

This part of the TimeEval documentation includes a couple of usage guides to get you started on using TimeEval for your own projects.
The guides teach you TimeEval's APIs and their usage, but they do not get into detail about how TimeEval works.
You can find the detailed descriptions of TimeEval concepts [here](../concepts/index.md).
